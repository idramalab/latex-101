### Formatting (High-Priority)

1. Tables: right-align columns with numbers
2. Unless you have a valid reason, figures and tables should be at the top of the page [t]
3. Use thousand comma separator: 10000 -> 10,000 in both text and plots. 
4. Consider using k or M as much as possible. E.g., 10k, 10M, etc.
5. For quoted text use ``text'' and `text'
6. Subordinate clauses starting with "which": there usually needs to be a comma before → “blah blah, which”
7. Always add a tilde before \cite{} → Blah et al.~\cite{X} show (except in cases where the sentence starts with \cite{} or \citet{})
8. However, never start a sentence with \cite{}, unless it’s in the aaai bib format, which makes it (Blah et al., 2019)
9. \footnote{} goes after the period if at the end of a sentence → blah blah blah.\footnote{fff}
10. Never use verb contracted forms. It’s -> it is, can’t -> cannot etc.
11. Use i.e., e.g., 
12. Capitalize Internet and Web (or at the very least be consistent)
13. Commas and periods go inside quotes → “blah.”  “blah,”
14. In LaTeX, the dash is written as double dash “--”, not a single one “-”. Long dash is ---. Also It’s blah -- blah blah -- blah blah, and blah blah---blah blah.
